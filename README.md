# arduino-electronic-lead-screw
Lathe electronic lead screw project (stepper driver).

In short, a project to implement an electronic lead screw (z axis) for a 
manual lathe.

The idea is to drive a stepper motor to turn the existing lead screw, 
and monitor the spindle RPM so that various feeds (including threads) 
can be automatically attained without the use of change gears etc. 


#Test setup

My test setup consists of:
* Arduino Uno
* A cheap 2M542 driver off ebay
* A Nema23 frame stepper motor (3Nm)
